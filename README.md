  # Weather Dashboard   

  ## Description
  ---

  The goal of this challenege was to create a weather dashboard that displays weather information for the city that you searched, as well as display a five-day forecast for said city. The program uses the OpenWeather API to grab current weather data for the city that you search, and calls both the currentweather and the five-day weather data for the city. The five-day cards are then dynamically generated and appended to the page.   

  ## Installation
  ---

  All you need to do is clone the repository! Everything else is run in the browser window.   

  ## Usage
  ---

  Type in a city in the search form, or select a city from the list of previously searched cities. Weather data will then be displayed based on what you searched.
